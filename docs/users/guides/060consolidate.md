# Consolidate dependencies of master

Semver dependencies could vary between two installations due to patch/fix auto update skill of semver. Sometimes this is useful for developers and integrators in order to get all patches and fixes from all its dependencies. But sometimes for C.I. purposes is more a problem than a solution.

In C.I. process is mandatory to lock all the versions of dependencies once you test one application. To do this we have two mechanism.

- 1. Shrinkwrap of tested installation in order to repeat allways same groups of dependencies whenever you install your app. This is made by finish command every time creating a file called _(bower/npm)_shrinkwrap.json.
- 2. When install this app our tool copy this file into the right one (npm_shrinkwrap.json/bower.json) and make the installation with it all the time.
- 3. If our software component is a dependency of another semver still works when our software component are needed as a dependency. So bower.json or package.json inside are with ^ or ~ semver methods...

## File _(npm/bower)_shrinkwrap.json

- This file es appended on any repository.
- Contains all locked version of the entire dependency tree.
- Is generated on every release or hotfix finish process.
- If you want to make a locked installation you have to copy this file into the right one. **_npm_shrinkwrap.json** -> **npm_shrinkwrap.json** or **_bower_shrinkwrap.json** -> **bower.json**
- pisco-plugin-bower or pisco-plugin-npm copy this file into the right one for you by adding lockedInstall properties into bower or npmDependencies configuration object on step config.json.

## Consolidation process

With this process is possible to update and test any software component that has dependencies keeping the shrinkwrap file updated all the time.

This flow do this steps:

- 1. start one branch
- 2. install npm or bower -F
- 3. execute shrinkwrap both (bower is a local tool developed by QPA team)
- 4. if there is any update execute validate
- 5. if everything is OK, increase one hotfix version to master (from x.y.z -> x.y.z-0)
- 6. if there is not any update do not do anything finish with NOT BUILT state.
